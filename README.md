1. AN ANSVVER OF A TRVE CHRISTIAN TO A COVNTERFAIT CATHOLIKE.

    _ The propoſition of the Aduerſarie.

      * The firſt article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The ſecond article conteyneth 4. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The third article conteyneth 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The fourth article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The fiueth article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The ſixth article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 7. article conteineth 3. demaundes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 8. article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The nynth article may be deuided into nyne demaundes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 10. article conteyneth in effect but 2. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 11. article is ſo confuſe that it is harde to bring it into any certeine numbre of demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 12. article hath 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 13. article hath 2. demaundes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 14. article hath 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 15. article conteyneth in effect 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 16. article conteyneth one demande, and one chalenge.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 17. Article conteyneth 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 18. article hath but one demande.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 19. article hath but one demande.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 20. article hath 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 21. article conteyneth but one demande.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 22. article, although it be very confuſe, yet it conteyneth in effect 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 23. article conteyneth 2. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 24. article conteyneth 10. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 25. article hath 2. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 26. article conteyneth in effect but 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 27. article conteyneth 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 28. article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 29. article conteyneth 8. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

    _ AN ANSVVERE TO THE PROPOSITION.

      * The firſt article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The ſecond article conteyneth 4. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

      * The third article conteyneth 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The fourth article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The fiueth article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The ſixth article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 7. article conteineth 3. demaundes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 8. article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The nynth article may be deuided into nyne demaundes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 10. article conteyneth in effect but 2. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 11. article is ſo confuſe that it is harde to bring it into any certeine numbre of demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

      * The 12. article hath 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 13. article hath 2. demaundes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 14. article hath 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 15. article conteyneth in effect 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 16. article conteyneth one demande, and one chalenge.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 17. Article conteyneth 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 18. article hath but one demande.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 19. article hath but one demande.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 20. article hath 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 21. article conteyneth but one demande.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 22. article, although it be very confuſe, yet it conteyneth in effect 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 23. article conteyneth 2. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 24. article conteyneth 10. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 25. article hath 2. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 26. article conteyneth in effect but 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 27. article conteyneth 5. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 28. article conteyneth 3. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.

      * The 29. article conteyneth 8. demandes.

1 Firſt I aske of the proteſtant what Church that was, which conuerted all theſe cuntries that be now Chriſtian, to the faith of Chriſt?

2 And let him ſhew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gentility, or Iudaiſme, to the true Religion of Chriſt, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in ſteede of true Chriſtianity.

3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.

1 I aſke of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Chriſtian people through the whole worlde, to geue moſt humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?

2 VVhat Church hath had the diſcerning & ſeuering of them from other writinges of all ſortes?

3 VVhat Church hath had the cuſtodie of them, and moſt ſafely hath preſerued them, for the neceſſary vſe of God his people, and from the corruption of aduerſaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all ſortes?

4 And let the Proteſtant declare to me, that their Congregation hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, ſauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Teſtament, as the true religion conteyned in the ſame?

2 Shew me why, ſhe kept not ſo ſafely, and faithfully, the true ſenſe of God his word, as ſhe preſerued the word it ſelfe?

3 Shew me why, we ſhould beleue the Papiſtes, as you terme them, for the word it ſelf, and rather you Proteſtants thā them, for the meaning of the word.

4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, & will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted ſenſe of the ſame booke?

5 Laſt of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, ſhew me good reaſon or Scripture for theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 I demand, what Church hath mightely gonne through, borne downe, and fully vanquiſhed, all hereſies in times paſt, aſwell againſt the bleſſed Trinitie, as other Articles of our religion?

2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes ſtande ſtill, and ſtedfaſt, whileſt all other Congregations, as well of Arrians, as Anabaptiſtes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilantians, Iouinians, and the reſt haue decaied.

3 And if it can be proued that either the Proteſtants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne theſe foreſayd ſectes, and other of all ſortes, I recant.

1 Againe, what Church is that, which hath exerciſed by Chriſtes appointement, Diſcipline, vpon offendors in all degrees?

2 And for that purpoſe, hath continually executed lawes and Canons Eccleſiaſticall, with Excommunication, Degradation, ſuſpenſion, and ſuch like.

3 Proue me this geere to procede from Proteſtants, or from any other Church than the Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe from what Church, did all the ſolemne ceremonies, and obſeruations, all feſtiuall dayes, all faſtes, all diſtinctions, and varieties of ſeruice, by diuerſities of ſeaſons, and times of the yeare, (proceede.)

2 From whence did all thinges, yet indifferently for moſt part, obſerued, and allowed, on both ſides, from whence did they proceede?

2 And if it can be proued, that the Proteſtants Congregation, or any other Church, but ours, hath inſtituted and ordered all theſe, or any of theſe, for the comelineſſe and honour of God his houſe, I recant.

1 Further I aske them, what Church that is, which hath brought forth out of her wombe, ſo many noble perſonages, of Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctors, Virgines, and holy Sainctes, of all ſortes, all which both they and we doe outwardly profeſſe, by the continuance of the Callendare, which yet is vſed euery where, to be Sainctes in heauen.

2 And if it can be proued by any man of the Proteſtancy, that theſe were either, of the Proteſtants Congregation, or beleefe when they were aliue.

3 Or canonized and allowed for Sainctes by the Proteſtantes Church, when they were deade, or by any other Church, then I recant.

1 And becauſe Chriſt as S. Paule ſayeth, hath eſtabliſhed in his Church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prechers, ſome Teachers, and Doctors euen vntill his comming againe, I aſke the Proteſtant, what Church that is, which is able to ſhew & proue, the continuance and vſe of the ſaide functions euer ſence Chriſtes time by plaine accompt of orderly Succeſſion.

2 And is able to name you by the hiſtories of all ages, the notable perſonnes of all the forſaide ſtates, in their gouernment and miniſterie.

3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the ſame appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatiō but ours hath kept that charge, thē I recant.

1 And for the neceſſary vſe and execution of the foreſayd offices, they muſt further be aſked, what Sacramentes the Proteſtants miniſtred for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares togither, in which they confeſſe their congregations to haue bene neare or elſe wholy hidden.

2 VVhat correction they kept and diſcipline for offenders.

3 To whome they did preach their Fayth.

4 How did they reproue hereſies?

5 VVhere did their principall Paſtors ſit in Iudgement?

6 VVhere did they gather as in Councells to try the trueth of doubtfull matters?

7 How might Chriſtian men, iuſtly offended with ſome of their brethern, haue ſought out your officers or Congregation, to make complainct of him?

8 Or how if it had liked any man to haue ben baptized of them, or to haue receiued the communion of them, or to haue bene married of them, or to haue ioyned them ſelues in Fayth and Religion to them, how might I ſay that ſecret, contemptible, and vnknowne company, be founde in this caſe?

9 If therefore you can ſhew me, that any man euer ſought Iuſtice or knowledge of trueth, ſacrament, or faith, or any helpe of Saluation at the Proteſtants ſecret and cloſe congregation, or any other where, but of Gods knowen Catholike Church, I recant.

1 Moreouer I aſke whether for all theſe many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a miniſter of Iuſtice and an executor of Chriſtian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.

1 Againe I requier of the Proteſtants to declare by good hiſtories, or by reaſonable likelihoode when the true church, as they compt theirs, decayed?

2 VVhat yeare the Religion of the Papiſtes came in and preuayled?

3 VVhether all their true Church was ſo ſoundly ſleeping, that none could preach againſt it as it firſt entred.

4 VVHether all nations ſodenly and in one yeare were moued to the doctrine of the Papiſtes, no one man of all their true Church neither preaching, teaching, writing, nor attempting any thing againſt it, or making mention of it.

5 VVhether ſodenly all bookes of ſeruice were altered?

6 VVhether in a moment, the Maſſe was ſaide in ſteede of other Apoſtolike Communion?

7 VVhether men beganne ſodenly to praye for the ſoules departed?

8 Sodenly required the helpe of Sainctes in heauen?

9 Sodenly the tongue of common prayers altered?

10 Tell me what yeare of our Lorde, vnder what Emperour, vnder what Pope, by whome theſe thinges were wrought, vpon what occaſion, this marueillous mutation was made?

11 VVho preached againſt it, what hiſtorie maketh mention
of it, who of all your Paſtors preached againſt it, was God his Church ſo voide of the ſpirit of Trueth, and ſtrength, that euen then when it moſt floriſhed, it had none that durſt open againſt ſuch corruption of religion, as it entred in, and when it might ſoone haue bene repreſſed?

12 If it coulde not, ſhew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with ſtand this doctrine?

13 Or note the name of him that euer firſt preached any article of our doctrine: and if we note you not by their names, euery one of your Capitaines, and the ſeuerall errors that they tought and the time, and the yeare when they aroſe
againſt the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, ſaye this can be done of your ſide towarde vs, or if we doe it not for improofe of your Church and religion, I recant.

14 And for that purpoſe becauſe the gouernment of the Byſhop of Rome is moſt miſliked of them, and yet moſt notoriouſly knowne by euery hiſtorie, let them name the Pope that firſt brake of the courſe of his forefathers beleefe, & regiment in any article of fayth or neceſſary Chriſtian vſage, and I recant.

1 Item I aſke what kinde and order of ſeruice, or common prayer, what waye of miniſtring of the ſacraments your
〈1 page duplicate〉〈1 page duplicate〉Church had: before Papiſtry (as you call it) did preuaile in the worlde?

2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you liſt that was in Engliſh, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or ſacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preeſt coulde not conſecrate nor ſay Maſſe, himſelfe, or ſhew any note in a Communion booke, that the people ſhoulde take the ſacrament for plaine breade, or that they ſhould geue no honor to it, ſhew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.

3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authenticall ſeruice but ours, and I recant.

1 Furthermore I requier to know what ſhoulde be the cauſe that the Proteſtants themſelues, doe receiue all Byſhops, Prieſtes, Deacons, and other officers ſpirituall of all ſortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men lawfully and ſufficiently ordered, both to preach, miniſter ſacraments, and to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction no leſſe, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any ſpirituall function than other lay men.

2 Therefore vpon this preſumption that they doe not onely admit our miniſtring of ſacraments, but alſo the lawfull ordering of the miniſters for the ſame, if they can ſhew me why our church hauing by their owne conſent and approuing lawfull prieſtes and biſhops ſhould not be the true church, I recant.

1 Alſo I demande what furniture or commodity in ſeruing God the Chriſtianity of any age, or any part of Chriſtendome had euer by your Congregations?

2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your aſſemblies and ſeruice?

3 VVhat Biſhoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?

4 VVhat Vniuerſities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?

5 Name one Church, not builded in all faſhions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vſe of the chalices, the ſignification of the veſtiments, as alſo for the ſpeciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Chriſt, either erected for your Faith, Church, & ſeruice, or not prepared, in all ſorts for catholike practiſes: Proue vnto me that any of all thoſe thinges were euer prouided for any other ſeruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of any other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.

1 Againe name any one company of men in the Chriſten world that in all articles of Faith, be in one meaning and belefe.

2 Or in thinges where they doubt, be contented to ſubmit their ſeuerall meaninge to the iudgement of their Superiours.

3 And to that communion and companie wherof they be, name any companie of men agreeing and thus humbly affected in Chriſtes Religion, ſauing the bleſſed fellowſhip and members of the Catholike communion, and I recant.

Furthermore name any one man that is confeſſed on both ſides by the iudgement of the world, to be holy and learned, & a member of the true Church, in what age ſoeuer you liſt ſence Chriſtes time, and proue him to haue bene in all articles of Faith of the Proteſtants meaninge.

Yea if I bring not the aduerſaries them ſelues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy againſt their doctrine in diuers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.

1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Calueniſtes, Confeſſioniſtes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, be all of one Church?

2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that theſe, being of ſuch diuerſitie in faith and religion make one Church.

3 Or that each of their ſects may giue ſaluation to their folowers, being ſo diſagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.

4 Or that I ſhould beleue all theſe rather then the Catholike Church, or one of theſe more then another, all making ſuch a bold chalenge of the truth and Goſpell.

5 Let the Proteſtants of all theſe kindes put their heades together, and ſhew me a reaſon of theſe thinges, and with all, let them among them ſelues agree, to what ſorte of theſe ſectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.

I demande whether they were euer of the true Catholike church, which either tooke to them ſelues newe names of religion according to the calling of any ſecte maiſter, or liked not ſo well the name of Catholike or Chriſtian as of their ſeuerall teachers, as to be called of Arius, Arians, or of Caluine, Caluiniſtes, or of Luther, Lutheranes, or Proteſtants &c. if any man therefore can proue vnto me that
men which haue choſen to themſelues to declare their diuerſitie of faith, from the common knowen Catholike church ſuch newe names, ſhoulde be of the Catholike church, I recant.

Againe, if theſe, which by the common calling and iudgement of Chriſtian people, be named and commonly taken for heretikes, haue not in all ages proued them ſelues in the ende to be heretikes in deede, notwithſtanding their craking of Gods worde, and therefore that the Proteſtants being ſo taken and called, proue not ſo in deede, I recant.

1 Likewiſe, if any man can proue vnto me, that either thoſe be not true Chriſtians, which by the conſent of nations, and by olde preſcription of ſo manye yeares as be ſith their conuerſion, be and euer hath bene called Catholikes.

2 Or that thoſe can be any true members, or children of the Catholike church, which do miſlike and miſtruſt ſo farre-forth theſe holy names, as wel of Church, as Catholike that they haue turned thē into Congregations, and Goſpellers, and Proteſtants, and ſuch like.

3 If therefore any thing can proue our true Church better than the honorable name of Catholike, or more condemne them to be out of Chriſtes church thā that not only the Chriſtiā worlde geueth it not to them, but they in a name, do refuſe the ſame them ſelues, then do I recant.

1 Moreouer, I aſke of the Proteſtants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or loſt: the people that learned this article of their Creede
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they ſawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Chriſtened, and receyned all other ſacraments, and commodities of ſaluation, whether they were bounde, I ſay, to beleue this vnknowen and cloſe Congregation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued, or coulde receiue any benefit, and ſo forſake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and ſacraments: Shew me therefore that the Chriſtian men of theſe dayes, were charged to beleeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.

1 I aske alſo whether any man for the ſpace of that 1000. yeres of blindenes could be ſaued, out of that ſecrete and ſmall Church, which they ſay was the true Church, if they aunſwer
me, there might be ſome ſaued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowſhip of the Papiſtes out of the Proteſtants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they ſay that none could be ſaued by our Sacraments out of their cloſe Church, then all men yong and old periſhed for thoſe yeares without any hope of mercy, becauſe they could not vnite them ſelues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes ſurmiſe. Therefore let any man aliue proue vnto me that either any man could out of the true Church be ſaued.

2 Or that any other company could be knowne for the true and onely Church but our common Catholike ſocietie.

3 Or that all men were damned for a thouſand yeares togither becauſe they coulde not finde, nor ſurmiſe of any other Church, then that which practiſeth all holy functions, which Chriſt left for our ſaluation in the world, and I recant.

1 Againe ſhew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reaſon, a church of Chriſt in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no ſpirite of propheſying, no rodde of correction, no order of miniſtring nor any ſpirituall functiō that can be named, proue me that there ſhould be a true Church for a thouſand yeares together, and lacked all theſe thinges.

2 And withall, that there was an other vntrue Church which for thoſe many dayes onely practiſed to the ſaluation of many, all theſe offices: and geue me a good reaſon why this Church, that alwayes hath had theſe thinges ſhould be a falſe Church, and the other that wanted them, to be a true Church, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man ſhew how that Church can be the piller of truth, which durſt not for a thouſand yeares clayme either preaching of Gods word or miniſtring of Sacramēts or ſhew her ſelfe againſt falſhood or ſuperſtition.

2 Let any man ſhew that all giftes of the ſpirite, and functions of the holy Ghoſt haue bene taken from her, a thouſand yeares togither, and onely practiſed to the peoples vſe by an aduouterous Church.

3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Chriſtes promiſe and warrant for her, not bene voyd & fruſtrate, if a baſtard Church exerciſing idolatry, as they ſay, hath ſpoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Chriſtianitie, almoſt euer ſince Chriſtes tyme.

4 Let me ſee therefore howe the onely dearling and ſpouſe of Chriſt ſhoulde be neglected of him ſo long.

5 Let the aduerſarie ſhew that the Church ſhoulde euer by ſuperſtition and falſhood commit adultery or be deuorced from him.

6 Or that Chriſt ſhould euer want his ſpouſe in earth.

7 Or that he ſhoulde be a heade either without a bodie.

8 Or ſuch an vnknowne and ſmall bodie.

9 Or that Chriſtes only kingdom ſhould become ſo cōtemptible.

10 Or that his ſpouſe in earth ſhoulde euer lacke the ſingular prerogatines of Gods ſpirite, ſhewe me theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 Shew me that the Church, which ought to be a Chriſtian mans ſtaye, in all troubles and tempeſtes of doctrine might become ſo hidde or ſo cloſe that no man coulde finde her.

2 Or ſo harteles that ſhe coulde ſuccour no man nor inſtruct any man in his doubt of conſcience or diſtreſſe of Faith, proue me that there maye be ſuch a decay of Gods ſpirite, trueth, and Church, and I recant.

1 Shew me againe whether any man of yeares may be ſaued, except he beleue the Catholike Church?

2 And that is it which hath in the face of all the worlde practiſed preaching: the conuerſion of nations to the obedience of the Goſpell: that hath alwaies had the miniſtring of ſacraments, the hearing of matters in controuerſie, power Iudiciarie in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the orderly ſucceſſion of Byſhops, vniformitie in ſolemne ceremonies, vnity in faith, that hath in her ſelfe all holy functions of the ſpirite, as working of miracles, remiſſion of ſinnes, the true ſence and interpretation of Gods word that is bewtified by the diuerſitie of ſtates, commended by Chriſt in the Goſpell, as with Virgines, with Martyrs, with Confeſſors, and the reſt.

3 Proue vnto me that this is not the true Church, or that we be not bound to obey this Church and no other in all controuerſies, and doubtes rayſed either by the difficultie of the Scripture, or by the vayne contention & pride of hereſie, and I recant.

1 Moreouer let any man proue vnto me, that the true & onely Church of God, may at any time be voyd of God his ſpirite.

2 Or falſely interprete any ſentence of holy Scripture.

3 Or induce any error among the people.

4 Or approue any vnprofitable or hurtefull vſage among Chriſtians.

5 Or that ſhe ſuffereth any man, damnably abuſing her religion, without open reprehenſion thereof, proue any of theſe thinges, and I recant.

1 If vnitie in Faith, auſteritie of life, ſharpe diſcipline, great penance, much faſting, large almes, godly deuotion, obedience to higher powers, grauitie and conſtancie in all caſes, be not the ſignes of the true Church.

2 Or be not more in our Church then in their Congregation, I recant.

3 But if diſcorde in religion, licentiouſnes in lyuing, contempt of Diſcipline, reiecting of penance, lotheſomneſſe of faſting, lacke of zeale and deuotion, diſobedience to Magiſtrates, ſacriledge, apoſtacie, breach of vowes, vnlawfull luſtes, wantonneſſe in all life and maners, if theſe thinges, I ſay, agree not better to the Proteſtants, than the Catholikes, or if theſe be not the plaine ſignes and fructes of a falſe church, and doctrine, I recant.

1 Let any Proteſtant in the worlde, proue vnto me, that their church coulde rightly be called Catholike, which was ſo particular, that no man aliue coulde name a place where any ſuch church was.

2 Or that it might be called holy, which neuer had Baptiſme, or other ſacramentes, to ſanctifie any of her followers withall.

3 Or that it ſhould be one, which as ſoone as it grew vp in the world, was diuided into ſo many ſundry ſectes.

4 Or that it might be called Apoſtolike, which could neuer coūt by orderly ſuceſſion from any Apoſtle, or Apostolike man.

5 Or the ſecret, baſe, contemptible, defaced, and diſordered Congregation, was euer of that maieſtie, that it might require the obedience of all Nations.

6 Or that it was euer able to gather generall Councels.

7 Or exerciſe Diſcipline.

8 Or that theſe names, proper by ſcripture and Doctors of the true Church, coulde be euer chalenged, by any right to their ſaide Congregation.
