            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Againe of what force your Canonization is to be e≈øteemed, we may learne by a fact of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. who condemned, digged vp, and burned the bodie of <hi>Hermannus in Ferraria,</hi> 30. yeares after his buriall, who had bene wor≈øhipped for a ≈øainct aboue 20. yeares before, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øeth <hi>Platina</hi> and other. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ≈øeuenth canonized Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> which was an Arrian, as <hi>S. Hieronym</hi> te≈øtifieth, Moreouer if I ≈øhoulde likewi≈øe demande of you, what Pope canonized <hi>Peter, Paule,</hi> and the re≈øt of the Apo≈øtles, yea mo≈øt of the Martyrs of the primitiue Church, you ≈øhall neuer be able to ≈øhew me either what Pope did it, or that any Pope did it: For ≈øeeing none may canonize but the Pope in your church, and you can not proue that the Pope hath canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Apo≈øtles and cheefe Martyrs, you can not proue that your church hath canonized the Apo≈øtles and principall Martyrs. But it is manife≈øt that your canonization is taken from the heathen Senate of Rome, which chalenged autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make Gods, whome they them ≈øelues thought be≈øt. And if I ≈øhoulde rippe vp the mo≈øt parte of tho≈øe Sainctes, which haue bene canonically canonized by the Pope, it were an ea≈øie matter to finde them heretikes, traitors, Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers, Whoremongers, and whores, as you may reade in <hi>Bales Votaries</hi> aboundantly, beleuing his reporte no farther than he alleageth his Author, where you maye finde it. Wherefore it were wi≈øedome for you, not to depend vpon the Pope his Canonization, but vpon God his approbation, and to recante.</p>

But when the kinges of the earth had committed fornication with the great whore of Babylon (as the holy Gho≈øt fore≈øheweth <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. and 18.) it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to our cau≈øe if we can not ≈øhew, any of them that haue mainteined our Religion. Yet becau≈øe you make ≈øo gentle an offer vpon the triall of ≈øuch a matter, which is of ≈ømall force either to the hurt of our cau≈øe or the maintenance of yours, I will let you vnder≈øtande what I haue reade for this purpo≈øe. Not doubting but other which haue reade much more, and ≈øeene more auncient hi≈øtories than I, can ≈øhew you a great deale more. I pa≈ø≈øe ouer as to well knowen, how many of the Grecian Emperors re≈øi≈øted the ≈øetting vp of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, in ≈øo much that in the Greeke church to this daye they can abide none in their temples, likewi≈øe I pa≈ø≈øe ouer <hi>Charles</hi> the great, who wrote a booke again≈øt Images, which

I will not rehear≈øe tho≈øe princes, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Popes lawes, defended their prie≈øtes, that were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: For although the≈øe and ≈øuch like defended ≈øome parte of the trueth, which we holde again≈øt you, yet le≈øt you ≈øhould obiect, it was but in ≈øome one or two pointes, I pa≈ø≈øe them ouer with ≈øilence.

Augu≈øtine</hi> preached in latine &amp; all the people vnder≈øtoode him, and that they might the better vnder≈øtand him, he doth v≈øe ≈øuch phra≈øes and termes which were not pure latine, but commonly v≈øed of the people as <hi>O≈ø≈øum,</hi> and <hi>Faenerare, &amp;c.</hi> But ≈øoone after his time, when the Gothes, and Vandalles, oueranne the Empire, the latine tongue which before was not pure among the people, began daily to be more corrupted, and yet remained after a ≈øort la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, vntill the yeare of our Lorde 768. when <hi>Charles</hi> the great began to raigne in France, and long after: for within the time of his reigne, which was 47. yeares, a Councell was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Turon, in France, what yeare it is not certeyne, but it is probable, that in the latter ende of his empire, in which it was decreed, that euery bi≈øhop, ≈øhould haue certeine homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <hi>Et ea≈ødem qui≈øque apert√® ≈øtudeat transferre in ru≈øticam Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam linguam aut Theoti≈øcam, quo facilius cuncti po≈ø≈øint intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere quae dicuntur. Turon.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. And that euery one ≈øtudye to tran≈ølate them plainly, into the ru≈øticall Romane tongue or into the Theoti≈øce tongue, that all men may more ea≈øily vnder≈øtand what is ≈øayd. By this Canon, it is euident, that at this time, the people vnder≈øtood the Latine tongue, though it were very rude and ru≈øtical. And where the Canon pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the ≈øame homilies to be tran≈ølated either into the rude latine tongue, or into the Theoti≈øce tongue. Although this word <hi>Theoti≈øca,</hi> ≈øeeme to be corrupted, yet it is mo≈øt certeine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23111:26"/>that they meant Dutch tongue, for as much as <hi>Carolus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> had a great part of Germanie vnder his dominion, and the Germanes, as neuer throughly ≈øubdued by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, neuer throughly receiued the latine tongue. Yet it is manife≈øt, that they vnder≈øtoode their common prayer in the latine tongue, though not perfectly, becau≈øe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ≈øayth: <hi>Quo facilius &amp;c.</hi> That all men may more ea≈øely vnder≈øtand, ≈øignifying that they vnder≈øtood the pure latine tongue though hardely and not perfectly. About the yeare of our Lorde 813. the knowledge of the latine tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne more and more to weare awaye, from amonge≈øt the common people, which when the bi≈øhops perceiued, they decreed in the Councell of Magunce, <hi>cap.</hi> 25. that euery Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, and holy daye, there ≈øhoulde be a ≈øermon in ≈øuch ≈øorte, that the common people might vnder≈øtand it: and in the 45. Canon. they decreed, that euery Chri≈øtian, ≈øhoulde learne the Creede, and the Lorde his prayer, <hi>Et qui aliter non potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vel in ≈øua lingua hoc di≈øcat,</hi> that is, And he that can not, yet let him learne it in his owne tongue. Whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they de≈øier to reteine the latine tongue ≈øtill, but rather than the people ≈øhoulde be ignorant, they commande them to learne their prayers and beleefe in their mother tongue. Al≈øo by the 43. Canon, wherein they iudge that no pree≈øte can ≈øaye Ma≈ø≈øe alone, it appeareth that the people commonly vnder≈øtood the latine ≈øeruice: for they a≈øke how he ≈øhoulde ≈øaye: <hi>Dominus vobi≈øcum,</hi> and admoni≈øh the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to lifte vp their heartes, and diuers like ≈øayinges, where there is none by him but him ≈øelfe. Nowe if the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtoode not the≈øe ≈øayinges, it were all one, whether they were pre≈øent or ab≈øent. Al≈øo in the Councell of Rhenes, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Fraunce about the ≈øame time, the like decree was made <hi>cap.</hi> 15. that bi≈øhops ≈øtudie to preache ≈øermons, and homelies of the holy fathers ≈øo that all men maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, according to the property of their tongue. Finally in the Councell of Laterane holden vnder Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1215. in which Councell tran≈øub≈øtantiation was fir≈øt e≈øtabli≈øhed, the 9. chapter, it was plainely decreed that fora≈ømuch as within one citie and dioce≈ø≈øe people of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23111:27"/>diuers languages be mingled together, hauing vnder one Faith, diuers rites, and maners, we ≈øtreightly commande, that the bi≈øhops of ≈øuch cities and dioce≈ø≈øes, prouide able men, which according to the diuer≈øitie of their rites, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, celebrate vnto them, the diuine ≈øeruice, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter the ≈øacramentes, in≈øtructing them both by worde and example. Hereby it appeareth, that when the latine tongue, was either almo≈øt, or altogether growen out of the common peoples vnder≈øtandings, order was taken that common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ≈øhould be ≈øayed and ≈øacramentes mini≈øtred in the mother tongue of euery nation. But the bi≈øhops which ≈øhoulde haue ≈øeene it put in execution, either negligently omitted it, or willingly refu≈øed to doe it, becau≈øe it was more for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to kepe the people in blinde ignorance. So thus I haue ≈øhewed, that ≈øodenly the tongue of common prayer, was not altered.</p>

Yea but you will ≈øaye, they were condemned for tho≈øe opinions, as erroneous.

Wherefore, if <hi>Aerius</hi> had not bene an Arrian, this opinion coulde not haue
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23111:28"/>made him an heretike. Al≈øo he tought that fa≈øting dayes are not to be ob≈øerued, if he e≈øpied the ≈øuper≈øtition of fa≈øting dayes and reproued it, that was no error at all. But if <hi>Aerius</hi> was an heretike, for denying prayer for the deade to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, why were the <hi>Heracleonites,</hi> accu≈øed of here≈øie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they buried their deade with inuocations <hi>Epiph. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Haere≈ø.</hi> 36. <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> al≈øo by authoritie of <hi>Phila≈øter</hi> chargeth the ≈øame <hi>Aerius,</hi> with ab≈øtinence from fle≈øh, if this be an here≈øie, then be all Papi≈øtes heretikes, which compte ab≈øtinence from fle≈øh an holy fa≈øt. Againe you will bring in <hi>Iouiniane,</hi> which affirmed that virginitie was no better than mariage, which if it be well vnder≈øtoode, is no error at all: for although virginitie in ≈øome ca≈øes and re≈øpectes, and for ≈øome per≈øons is better than mariage: yet is it not ≈øimply, that is in all re≈øpectes and ca≈øes, and for all per≈øons better than matrimonie. And if he tought further that ≈øuch as coulde not conteine, though they had vowed Virginitie, ≈øhoulde neuerthele≈ø≈øe be maried, this was the doctrine of <hi>S. Paule:</hi> It is better to marry than to burne. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was of the ≈øame iudgement, although he compte it an offence to marrie after their vowe, yet he ≈øayeth: It is better to marry then to burne. <hi>Melius e≈øt itaque vnum peccatum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere, &amp; non plura, &amp;c.</hi> It is better to haue one offence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then many.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if <hi>Iouinian</hi> taught that fa≈øting, ab≈øtinence from certeyne meates, and other bodily exerci≈øe of them ≈øelues profit litle, his doctrine agreeth with <hi>S.

La≈øt of all <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> ≈øhall be brought in, who wrote again≈øt inuocation of Saincts, ≈øuper≈øtition of reliques, and other ceremonies, him <hi>Ieronym</hi> reproueth or rather rayleth on him: for his rea≈øons are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth that he hath again≈øt him, therefore how≈øoeuer <hi>Ieronym</hi> e≈øtemed him in his rage, if he had none other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions contrary to the truth: we doubt not to acknowledge <hi>Vigilantius</hi> (as many godly and learned Bi≈øhops of his tyme did) for a true preacher and reprehender of that ≈øuper≈øtition whereunto <hi>Ieronym</hi> was to much addict, although he doe ≈øomewhat qualifie the matter.

Moreouer if you marke the mo≈øt parte of olde churches in Englande you ≈øhall plainely ≈øee, that the chancells are but additions builded ≈øence the churches, of likelihoode by the par≈øons that di≈ødained to haue their place in the midde≈øt of the people as the olde manner was.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23111:51"/>as it is declared before, ≈øhe hath no ≈øuch priuilege graunted, but that ≈øhe may be deceiued, in ≈øome thinges: for her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is vnperfect, and her prophecying is vnperfect. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And it is true that <hi>S. Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayeth: euen the whole church is taught to ≈øaye: <hi>Forgeue vs our tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes.</hi> And if generall Councells be the church repre≈øented (as you Papi≈øtes doe teache) <hi>S. Augu≈øtine</hi> plainely affirmeth that they may erre: <hi>De Bapti≈ømo contra Donati≈øtas, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Quis autem ne≈øciat ≈øanctam ≈øcripturam Canonicam tam veteris quam noui Te≈øtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti &amp;c.</hi> And who knoweth not, that the holy Canonicall ≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as well of the olde, as of the newe Te≈øtament, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined within her certeine boundes: and that it is ≈øo prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before all later writinges of by≈øhops, that of it, no man may in any wi≈øe doubt, or di≈øpute, whether it be true, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right, what ≈øo euer is knowen to be written therin: and that the writings of bi≈øhops, which haue bene written, or are now in writinge, maye be reprehended, if they haue gonne a≈øtraie, any thing from the trueth, both by the ≈øaying that is perhaps more wi≈øe, of any man, that is more ≈økilfull in that matter, and by the more graue authoritie and wi≈øedom of other better learned bi≈øhops, and al≈øo by Councells: and that euen tho≈øe Councells which are gathered in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or prouince, ought to geue: place without all doubt, to the authoritie of the generall Councells, which are gathered out of all the Chri≈øtian worlde: and that euen the very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells, may often be amended, the former by the later, when as by any triall of thinges, that is opened, which before was ≈øhut, and that is knowen which before was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, without any ≈øwelling of wicked pride, without any ≈øtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berne≈ø≈øe of arrogance, without any contention of peui≈øhe enuie: with holy Humility, with Catholike peace, with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian charity. Thus farre, <hi>S. Augu≈øtine,</hi> which cleerely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that generall Councells may often erre, which maye often be amended, but that the authority of God his worde, is to be preferred before the writings of all Doctors, and Decrees of all Councells, and that it onely can not erre. The Councell of Carthage the 3. ca. 23. determined, that all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the altar, ≈øhoulde be directed onely to the Father, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23111:52"/>not to the Sonne, or the holy Gho≈øt, whether this be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to define that it is vnlawfull to pray to God the Sonne, and God the holy Gho≈øt, let euery man iudge. But you will except, that this was a prouinciall Synode, and not a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell. But I aun≈øwere you, it hath the authoritie of a generall Councell, becau≈øe it was confirmed in the ≈øixt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell holden at Con≈øtantinople in Trullo. And as for the Popi≈øh church, that it maye erre, what neede we better proofe than the prayer, which it maketh, after the ending of euery generall Councell, <hi>Precamur ≈øcilicet vt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiae parcas &amp; errori indulgeas,</hi> that is we praye truely that thou woulde≈øt ≈øpare our ignorance &amp; pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> our error. And againe, <hi>Et quia con≈øcientia remordente tabe≈øcimus, ne aut igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia nos traxerit in errorem, aut praeceps for≈øitan voluntas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulerit a Iu≈øtitia declinare, ob hoc te po≈øcimus, te rogamus, vt ≈øi quid offen≈øionis in hac Concilij celebritate attraximus, condonare, &amp; remi≈ø≈øibile facere digneris.</hi> that is: And becau≈øe we are gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with remorce of con≈øcience, le≈øt either ignorance haue drawen vs into error, or perhaps ra≈øh will hath driuen vs to decline from Iu≈øtice, therefore we praye thee, we be≈øeech thee, that if we haue drawen vnto vs any offence in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Councell, thou woulde≈øt vouche ≈øafe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and to make it remi≈ø≈øible &amp;c. If it be impo≈ø≈øible for the generall Councell to erre, what neede they pray to God to pardon their error, and when their owne con≈øcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them and compelleth them to confe≈ø≈øe, and that before God, that they may erre, what impudence is it in any man, to contend that they can not erre? Furthermore the ≈øecond Councell of Nice, determined that Angels, and ≈øou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of men had bodies, were vi≈øible, and circum≈øcriptible, and therefore might be painted, and this it affirmeth to be the iudgement of the Catholike church, <hi>Con. Nice.</hi> 2. <hi>Actione</hi> 5. If this be not to induce an error, to make men beleue that Angells and ≈øpirites haue bodies vi≈øible and circum≈øcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there was neuer anye error ≈øence the worlde beganne. Finally, when they ≈øay the Pope can not erre, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ≈øuch generall Councells as condemned Popes, for heretikes, did erre, as the ≈øixt generall Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23111:52"/>in Trullo, which condemned and accur≈øed Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> for an heretike, <hi>Actione</hi> 13. Euen as Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> the 2. did al≈øo, as appeareth in his epi≈øtle, to the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantine.</hi> Al≈øo the Councell of Con≈øtance did erre, which condemned Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. for denying the immortality of the ≈øoule, and the re≈øurrection of the body. <hi>Se≈ø≈øion.</hi> 11. which Councell, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> him ≈øelfe affirmed to be mo≈øt holy, and that it coulde not erre. <hi>Se≈ø≈øion.</hi> 12. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Ba≈øile did erre, which depo≈øed Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the 4. <hi>Se≈ø≈øion.</hi> 34. the ≈øame Councell being confirmed by Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> the 5. <hi>Se≈ø≈øion.</hi> 43. If you ≈øay: the≈øe two la≈øt Councells did not erre, in condemning and depo≈øing the≈øe Popes: Then the great generall, and OEcumenicall Councell of Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and Florence, did erre, in di≈øallowing the determination of the≈øe Councells. Thus it is manife≈øt that the Romi≈øh church, which they them ≈øelues confe≈ø≈øe, to be repre≈øented in a generall Councell, may erre, which hath ≈øo often erred. And if it may erre, and be deceiued it ≈øelfe, what man is he, that neede to doubt: Whether it maye iuduce any error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.</p>
